                <p>Hi there!</p>

                <p>I'm a full stack developer with extensive experience in JavaScript (React.js, Node.js, React Native). I've also worked with Ruby/Ruby on Rails, SQL, C#, and Python.Â In my current role, I'm building out the mobile presence for an Austin-based startup, in React Native and Ruby/Rails</p>

                <p>I am fascinated by technology and the capabilities it has to shape society. With a background in the business world and strong experience as a developer, I've built the skills needed to explore this interest.</p>

                <p>I love learning about and experimenting with new technologies, and software engineering gives me the change to do that on a daily basis. I'm also a wannabe chef, musician, and avid outdoorsman.</p>

                <p>I'm confident that with my unique background, I can be an asset to any company. I value curiosity, hard work, and discipline, and try to reflect these qualities in everything I do. If you are of a similar mindset, I'd love to connect.</p>
